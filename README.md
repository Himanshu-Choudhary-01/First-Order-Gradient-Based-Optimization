# First-Order-Gradient-Based-Optimization

This repository provides a research-oriented implementation of **first-order gradient-based optimization algorithms**, with a particular emphasis on **Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding methods (ISTA and FISTA)**.

The implementations in this repository are inspired by and partially motivated by the methodology and documentation presented in the following resource:

Yunhui Gao, ISTA Documentation, available at: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Yunhui-Gao/ISTA/blob/master/docs/README.html

This code was originally developed around **2020** and reflects the algorithmic and software ecosystem of that period. The implementation prioritizes clarity, mathematical correctness, and reproducibility, making it suitable for academic research, method comparison, and
educational purposes.
