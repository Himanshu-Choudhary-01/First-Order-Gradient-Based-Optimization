# First-Order-Gradient-Based-Optimization

This repository provides a research-oriented implementation of **first-order gradient-based optimization algorithms**, with a particular emphasis on **Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding methods (ISTA and FISTA)**.

The implementations in this repository are inspired by and partially motivated by the methodology and documentation presented in the following resource:
